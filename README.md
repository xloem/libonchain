# libonchain

This project holds a goal of making a library that reference large data held on blockchains.

The idea is to separate the blockchains and storage forms into modules that utilise each other.

Known chains that can do this (please add more):
  - datacoin (see DTCBrowser project)
  - bitcoin-sv (see scaling testnet, D:// B:// protocols, and metanet)
